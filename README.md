# Discounted Cash Flow in Python
DCF or Discounted Cash Flow is used in valuing equities.
This model is largely dependent on the assumption of rates (required rate, perpetual growth rate, and cashflow growth rate).
Here, I used TSLA as the sample stock but you can use any that is available in Yahoo Finance.
This is based on Finance & Science's video tutorial on finding the intrinsic value of a stock (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi-BQx4gE3k).

Library used:
- yfinance

Future improvements:
- input ticker and automate fetching the free cash flows from previous years
